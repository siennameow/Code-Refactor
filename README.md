# Code-Refactor

## Description 📝 

For this project I restructured the existing code to meet the clent's needs. The client is a marketing agency, and they want a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that their own site is optimized for search engines. I was given some acceptance criteria that the webpage should meets. 

After working on the code, the apllication does satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria for web accessibility. \
The semantic HTML elements are included and they follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. \
The accessible alt attributes are added to html. \
The heading attributes now fall in sequential order. \
The title is more concise and descriptive. \
The application's links are function correctly after fixiing up the anchor link. \
The efficiency of the CSS is increased after consolidating the selectors and properties. \
The CSS is follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements after organizing.\
Comments are added to the HTML and CSS code where I made changes.\
The final application resembles mock-up provided in the homework instructions.
